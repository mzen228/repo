...AVL Trees...

Height-balanced binary search trees

How is the height of a tree balanced?  Using a balance factor

Balance factors = height of left subtree - height of right subtree

balance factors is calculated on every node of a binary search tree

the balance factors of every node must be {-1,0,1} to be balanced

{-1,0,1} are the only valid balance factors for balanced tres

If the balance factors is greater than absolute valueo f 1 then the node is imbalanced

If any one node is imbalanced then the entire tree is considered to be 
imbalanced 

...Inseting AVL with rotations...
1. LL-rotation
2. RR-rotation
3. LR-rotation
4. RL-rotation

Rotations at the time of insertion (the time of creation of the tree)

Insertions can cause tree imbalances.  To balance the tree, you can rotate the tree.
